"Wait, just hang on a sec!"

I scream, but it gets me nowhere

I put all my strength into being afraid of

The limits that just kept on closing in
 

Reality is merciless

And time is especially tricky

It's like someone's snatching away the blanket I just can't sleep without


We laughed and fretted

Over silly things, nonsensical things

Once the final bell rings out

The fun times will be over, too


Bye-bye, yesterday

365 days' worth of lessons shoved into bags

Like always, like it's "see you tomorrow."

Bye-bye, yesterday

365 days' worth of happenings

If you've made me an adult, don't be showing me tears

Bye-bye, yesterday

365 days' worth of memories

Even if I grow up some more

They still won't fade a bit


The option wasn’t even open to me –

It’s not like I came because I wanted to

If I had to give a reason, it’s ’cause I’m opportunistic;

I went with the flow and found a good place to stop


In a place I didn’t think I had any expectations for
There were unexpected surprises, with premium service –
Before I knew it, it became hard to step away… what a pain!

Out of nowhere, it was soaking into me
To the very corners of my heart
Now, even if this all ends, it will keep growing;
Those words have become a path forward!

Bye Bye Yesterday:
365 days of feelings
Are just too much to handle;
It seems they’ll overflow – yeah, they’re gonna spill on out!
Bye Bye Yesterday:
365 days of lessons learned
Can’t simply be left behind
So let’s just carry them all and get going already!

Bye Bye Bye, Good – Good time;
Let’s move on, move on, move on, move on!
Bye Bye Bye, School – School life;
And goodbye to you too, you too, you too, you too!
Bye Bye Bye, Good – Good time;
Let’s move on, move on, move on, move on!
A unforgettable, School – School life;
Forever, ever, ever, ever more!

Bye Bye Yesterday:
Stuffing 365 days
Worth of education in our bags-
As we always do… as if saying, “See you tomorrow”!
Bye Bye Yesterday:
If 365 days of lessons learned
Have made me into an adult
I won’t even bother to show my tears

Bye Bye Yesterday:
365 days of emotions
Can’t simply be left behind
So let’s just carry them all and get going already!
Bye Bye Yesterday:
365 days of memories –
Even if I keep growing up
Their colors won’t fade in the slightest!
